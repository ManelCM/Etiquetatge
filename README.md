KNN and KMEANS CLASSFICATION for cloth images in PYTHON
# Image Classification Project

This repository contains code for an image classification project using K-means and KNN algorithms. 

## Introduction

In this project, we implement image classification for color and shape. We use the K-means algorithm for color classification and KNN for clothing classification.

## Usage

- Use `train_imgs` for K-means training.
- Use `test_data` for KNN classification.
- See individual method descriptions in the code for more details.

## Improvements

We have proposed various enhancements for both algorithms, aiming to improve initialization and accuracy.
